Great question, and exactly the right one. The short answer: the robot fleet is a sensor network, and every pick is a demand signal.

Here's the connection. When FleetMind orchestrates 47 robots across a warehouse, it sees every pick, every putaway, every movement in real time. That's not just robot health data. That's live consumption velocity. Which SKUs are moving, how fast, from which zones, at what rate compared to last week.

That data is what connects fleet orchestration to inventory:

- **Smarter replenishment replaces safety stock.** Instead of holding 2-3 weeks of buffer because you don't know when you'll run out, you have real-time burn rates. You replenish based on actual consumption, not forecasts.
- **Faster picks = faster ship.** Optimized routing means robots aren't sitting idle or blocking each other. Picks per hour go from 80-120 (manual) to 200-300 (robot-assisted). Orders ship same day instead of next day.
- **Fewer errors = fewer returns = less reverse inventory.** Manual pick error is 4%. Automated drops to 0.04%. That's inventory you don't have to hold twice.

On your two bonus points, that's exactly where Phase 2 goes:

1. **Vendor replenishment:** Fleet data becomes a consumption velocity API. Vendors see in real time what you're burning through and trigger just-in-time shipments. No more PO cycles based on monthly counts.

2. **Customer visibility:** Task completion data becomes a fulfillment status API. Customers see their order moving through the warehouse in real time. Trust goes up, invoice payment accelerates.

The result is exactly what you described. Less inventory and cash tied up at every level of the chain, and everyone gets paid faster because the data flows in both directions.

We wove this into the pitch as the Phase 2 vision. Appreciate the push, it makes the story much bigger than a robot dashboard.
