# X Post — FleetMind Hackathon Submission

I've spent the last 8 years building and exiting agencies. Today I entered my first hackathon and built a warehouse robot fleet orchestration platform from scratch in 6 hours and 37 minutes.

Not by hand. By directing AI agents.

Markster FleetMind AI: simulation-first control plane — task dispatch, A* routing, collision avoidance, battery management, live ops dashboard, Gemini insights. Deployed on Vultr, fully functional.

The point: if you understand the domain, AI lets you ship what used to take a team weeks.

Built for @lablabai x @Surgexyz_ "Launch & Fund" hackathon
